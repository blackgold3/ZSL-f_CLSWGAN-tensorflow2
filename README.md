We can download the paper and pytorch code from https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/zero-shot-learning/feature-generating-networks-for-zero-shot-learning/

We can download related data from https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/zero-shot-learning/zero-shot-learning-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/
And I transform the mat data to csv using matlab. We can also write a new read_data.py
PS: matlab command 'csvwrite('filename.csv', variable_name)'  as a reference

Finally,hope it helps.
